# disentanglement-metrics

A list of different metrics proposed in literature for quantifying disentanglement. I will write about each metric in detail (and possibly implement them) some day but that day is not today.

1. BetaVAE (Higgins et. al.)[1]

2. FactorVAE (Kim and Mnih)[2]

3. BetaTCVAE (Chen et. al.)[3]
